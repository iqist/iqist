# iQIST (Interacting Quantum Impurity Solver Toolkit)

> WARNING: The user manual for iQIST is far away from completeness. So we don't release it together with the source codes. In the future, we would like to publish it using the Gitbook. We are really sorry for that. Though the user manual is not ready, you can still find some useful information/tips in the following places.

## Installation

See the comments in iqist/build/make.sys, iqist/build/build.md, and iqist/build/Makefile.

## File Format

For the file formats of solver.ctqmc.in, atom.config.in, entropy.in, and sac.in, see the comments in iqist/src/base/m\_parser.f90.

For the file formats of solver.xxx.dat, see the codes in iqist/src/ctqmc/xxx/ctqmc\_dump.f90.

## CTQMC quantum impurity solver

See the comments in iqist/src/ctqmc/xxx/ctqmc\_control.f90, here xxx means 'azalea', 'gardenia', 'narcissus', 'begonia', 'lavender', 'camellia', 'pansy', and 'manjushaka'.
